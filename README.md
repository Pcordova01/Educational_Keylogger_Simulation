## Description

This project is a simple Python keylogger that captures keystrokes using the `pynput` library and sends the recorded input to a specified email address after every 10 keystrokes. It simulates how attackers might exfiltrate data â€” providing insight into defensive security, ethical hacking, and automation.

## Features

- Logs all keystrokes typed on the keyboard
- Sends captured keystrokes to a Gmail inbox
- Triggers email after every 10 keys
- Built for testing and learning about keylogging mechanisms
